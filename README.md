## THIS IS NOT MY OWN DATA AND I DO NOT CLAIM TO OWN IT! ##

This data was taken from Kyle Pastor at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kapastor/democratvsrepublicantweets?resource=download and is licensed CCO 1.0 Universal Public Domain. I uploaded this into a GitHub repository so it could be most flexibly used rather than through my own working directory (this is particularly useful for using Google Colab). I make no claim of ownership, credit, or responsibility for this dataset. Any questions, comments, or credit should be directed to Kyle Pastor.

I similarly do not encourage professional nor academic use of this specific upload beyond my own projects, and encourage you to instead use the data directly from Kaggle or Pastor unless circumstances otherwise prohibit doing so.
